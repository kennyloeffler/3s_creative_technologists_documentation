# Creative Technologists Documentation 3WS 19/20 
This is a documentation of my projects i have worked on in my first semester.

#### Why did i choosed the Creative Technologists course? 

In my first semester, i took part at the course "Processing for Designers". I´ve learned the basics about coding and interactive hardware. In this course i wanted to dive deeper in to coding and setting up hardware.

## Coding Lessons

At the first meetings, we learned how to set up our projects and how to structure them properly. Also we learned how to set up our own local server including librarys like "NPM". All this was to speed up our workflow and get fast results.

### What i learned:

Setting up a good work structure saves a lot of time!

## Drawing Machine

We had the task to build a working drawing machine. So first we started to prototype a basic drawing machine with Arduino Parts. The machine was working, but it drew only a straight line. We wanted to have a little bit more control of what the machine can draw. We realised, that we need more parts to build a drawing arm that can draw more intersting things. So we descided to build a new machine with new parts out of LEGO. Also the software and computer was replaced by the LEGO Mindstorm module.

### What i learned:

Prototype first!


## Tracing the City

The last task was to make a plot from .CSV data that comes out of the city of Berlin. CSV means "comma-seperated-values". It´s basicly a big table with lots of values and strings whitch are seperated by commas. 
For this task, we choosed to take the data of Wochenmärkte and Flohmärkte. The city of Berlin has a database of .CSV files that you can use for free (https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze). For the visualisation of the graphical elements, i first tried it with the JS library TURFJS (https://turfjs.org/), which is very good for mapping projects. I can probably use it again in future projects. Also i learned how to use librarys and extensions inside projects.

At the end of the semester, we didn´t finished the project and left it on our harddrives. After some weeks, we had zero motivation to finish it. But after some hours we managed to backward engineer the files from Fabian. Then we managed to integrate our own data in the modified file.

Due to the Corona Epidemic, we could not plot our final result.

### What i learned:

Write the code by yourself, when you can.
